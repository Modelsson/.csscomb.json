# .csscomb.json

Hello world!

This is my first custom CSS comb config file that is to spec with current CSS lint guidelines.
It succeeds in pure alphabetical order of all individual CSS properties, not just properties within the categories of the default config, and it does so without breaks between them.

If you want pure alphabetical order of CSS properties, this is the config for you.
